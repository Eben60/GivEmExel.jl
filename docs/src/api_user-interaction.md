## API user interaction

The user interaction API is based on a modified version of the package `SimpleArgParse.jl`. It is in principle agreed with the author of `SimpleArgParse.jl` to merge the changes I made to the package as v2, however for the time being I just included it into `GivEmExcel.jl` as a sub-package. For the documentation of `SimpleArgParse.jl v2` (still WIP) see [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Eben60/SimpleArgParse.jl/blob/maindev/docs/build/index.html).
